oFono - Open Source Telephony
*****************************

Copyright (C) 2008-2011  Intel Corporation. All rights reserved.


Compilation and installation
============================

In order to compile telephony stack you need following software packages:
	- GCC compiler
	- GLib library
	- D-Bus library

To configure run:
	./configure --prefix=/usr --mandir=/usr/share/man \
				--sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var

Configure automatically searches for all required components and packages.

To compile and install run:
	make && make install


Embedded Linux library
======================

In order to compile the daemon and utilities the development version of
Embedded Linux library is required to be present. The development
repositories can be found here:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/ell/ell.git
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/libs/ell/ell.git

The build systems requires that the Embedded Linux library source code
is available on the same top level directory as the source code:

	.
	|--- ell
	|    |--- ell
	|    `--- unit
	`--- ofono
	     |--- src
	     `--- tools

It is not required to build or install Embedded Linux library. The build
will happen when building the Wireless daemon and it will then be linked
internally.

When using --enable-external-ell build option, it is not required that the
Embedded Linux library source code is available in the top level directory.


Kernel Dependencies
===================

In order to have the PPP stack working in oFono you need to enable CONFIG_TUN
(Universal TUN/TAP device driver support) in your kernel .config.
