Network Monitor hierarchy
=========================

Service		org.ofono
Interface	org.ofono.NetworkMonitor
Object path	[variable prefix]/{modem0,modem1,...}

Methods		a{sv} GetServingCellInformation()

			Requests the latest serving cell information and basic
			measurements from oFono.  The returned value is a
			dictionary with the possible key / values documented
			below.  The type of cell is given by the 'Technology'
			property.

			Based on the type of cell, the dictionary will contain
			additional key/value pairs.  If a given key/value pair
			is not present, then it is not known or unsupported
			by the underlying driver.

			Refer to the sections below for which property types
			are available, their valid value ranges and
			applicability to different cell types.

			a{a{sv}} GetNeighbouringCellsInformation()

			Requests the neighbouring cells information and basic
			measurements from oFono.  The returned value is a
			dictionary with the possible key / values documented
			below.  The type of cell is given by the 'Technology'
			property.

			Based on the type of cell, the dictionary will contain
			additional key/value pairs.  If a given key/value pair
			is not present, then it is not known or unsupported
			by the underlying driver.

			Refer to the sections below for which property types
			are available, their valid value ranges and
			applicability to different cell types.

		void RegisterAgent(object path)

			Registers an agent which will be called whenever the
			modem registers to or moves to a new cell.

		void UnregisterAgent(object path)

			Unregisters an agent.

NetworkMonitorAgent Hierarchy [experimental]
=============================

Service		unique name
Interface	org.ofono.NetworkMonitorAgent
Object path	freely definable

Methods		void ServingCellInformationChanged(a{sv}) [noreply]

			This method is called whenever the serving cell
			information has been updated.

			Possible Errors: None

		void Release() [noreply]

			Agent is being released, possibly because of oFono
			terminating, NetworkMonitor interface is being torn
			down or modem off.  No UnregisterAgent call is needed.
